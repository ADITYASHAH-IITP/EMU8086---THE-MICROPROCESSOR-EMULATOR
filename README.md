# EMU8086---THE-MICROPROCESSOR-EMULATOR
To learn about 8086 - MICROPROCESSOR using the EMU8086 MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR<br><br>
### Aim of the Experiments.
1.Write a program to ADD and subtract two 16 bit number and also store carry for addition and borrow for subtraction.
2.Write a program to compute factorial of a number.
3.Write a program to multiply to 16 bit no using repetitive addition.
4.Write a program to divide to 16 bit no using repetitive subtraction.
5.Write a program to make a custom “For” loop and “while” loop.
6.Write a program to make a custom function using assembly language from using jump statements and other operations.
