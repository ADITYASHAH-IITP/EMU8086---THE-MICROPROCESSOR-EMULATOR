# EMU8086---THE-MICROPROCESSOR-EMULATOR<br>
To learn about 8086 - MICROPROCESSOR using the EMU8086 MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR<br><br>
### Aim of the Experiments.<br>
1.Write a program to ADD and subtract two 16 bit number and also store carry for addition and borrow for subtraction.<br>
2.Write a program to compute factorial of a number.<br>
3.Write a program to multiply to 16 bit no using repetitive addition.<br>
4.Write a program to divide to 16 bit no using repetitive subtraction.<br>
5.Write a program to make a custom “For” loop and “while” loop.<br>
6.Write a program to make a custom function using assembly language from using jump statements and other operations.<br>
<br><br>
### Pre-Requisites/Components Required<br>
In the Simulation Implementation I have used the following Software:<br>
